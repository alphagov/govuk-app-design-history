# Design history for the GOV.UK app

A record of the prototypes and user research insights from the team looking at a GOV.UK app and notifications.

## What is a design history

A design history can help your team log design decisions and create a permanent record of how your service has developed over time. 

This repo uses the [X-GOV design history template](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history-template) a community maintained project. Read this guide on how to [set up a design history](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/get-started/). 

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator with the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/).
