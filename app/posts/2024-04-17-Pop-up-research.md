## Hypotheses and results

1. Participants will be able to demonstrate their understanding of the app by accurately describing its purpose and scope when presented with the app home screen. **YES**
2. Participants will be able to complete key tasks  using the app prototype by tapping on the fastest pathway to task completion, without assistance, hesitation or taking an incorrect pathway.  **PARTIAL**
3. Participants will share positive first impressions of the app prototype by rating it VG/SG (very good/somewhat good). **YES**

## What we did

- 15 minute walk-up in-person research sessions:
    - Naturalistic browsing (orientation, understanding and discoverability)
    - Service and app tasks (findability and completion)
    - Reflections (understanding and evaluation)
- Two separate asynchronous activities (understanding and findability)
- Sample:
    - 12 x 16 - 24, 1 x 25 - 34
    - 4 x Android, 9 x iOS - all also used another device to go online
    - 2 with access needs

### What we showed users

We handed participants a test device with a Figma prototype pre-loaded. Participants could choose whether they preferred an iOS or Android device.

[iOS prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/iMyXbcvmrBbmYJ3H6KCKwo/GOV.UK-App---Lean-UR-prototype-(iOS)?page-id=1209%3A8534&type=design&node-id=1209-16333&viewport=1495%2C507%2C0.07&t=wEKofVDaIoCnnLR2-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1209%3A16333&mode=design)

[Android prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AQWiEELb5I7TZqz3VMszDN/GOV.UK-App-Android-demo-build?page-id=427%3A3741&type=design&node-id=439-9597&viewport=311%2C368%2C0.03&t=OHblaawfmrM4pn42-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=439%3A9597&mode=design)

### Tasks

1. What is the purpose of the app
2. How would you use this app to apply for Student Finance? (Happy search path)
3. How would you use this app to renew your passport? (Unhappy search path)
5. Find a service previously used in the app
6. Change One Login email / password
7. Describe the app to a friend

## Summary of insights

### Task completion

- All participants were able to open and log into app, find 'Apply for student loan', find where they would change their password and sign out.
- Some partipants were able to find how to renew their passport and see their previously used services.
- Participants struggled to find how they would login to Universal Credit (listed under 'Services') and renew their passport (unhappy search path).

### App rating

- 6 of the participants rated the app as Very Good and 4 Somewhat Good.

## What we learned

1. This design better supported service tasks than previous home page designs
2. We were able to engage with the visiting students in a meaningful and valuable way
3. 15 minute sessions are really short and our consent process takes a chunk of that time so we need to be leaner with our tasks 
4. A combination of research approaches gave us a more data points, but not as much depth
5. The noise in the area meant some sessions were more difficult than others

## Recommendations

1. Repeat this exercise with another age group to understand how robust this data is
2. Continue to explore the redirect search pattern for services not in the app - performance improved but 4 / 10 sessions were unable to reach a suitable end to the passport task
