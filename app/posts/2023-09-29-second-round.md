## Research objectives

- Explore and understand people’s behaviours and attitudes towards a gov.uk app
- Investigate the needs of people who interact with the government by using an app
- Inform next rounds of research
- Feed into the app proposition by identifying app concepts and opportunities

## What we did

- 1 Round of UR 
- 10 participants
- Concept testing:
- User profile and data reuse for reminders, setting up reminders, push notifications

## Summary of insights

1. Notifications need to be actionable, relevant and specific to be valuable to users, so we need to explore the implications and requirements of global notifications - both from a user perspective and an organisational one.

2. People expect a GOV.UK app to be safe because it’s the government but are concerned about scams due to previous experience and the prevalence of scams, we should explore how we can provide reassurance for users who need it.

3. Users are likely to have high expectations for what the app will enable them to do that we won’t be able to meet in MVP based on their experiences of other apps and GOV.UK, so we need to explore how we can manage user expectations about what the app can do.

4. Overall, users expected that this app would be valuable and beneficial in the following ways:
    - It would save them time, especially with reuse of data and easy process of signing in
    - It would save people from the letter overload or physical visit burden
    - It would allow them to add any dependents
    - It would keep them informed and up to date with what they need to do (check information, update documents, stay in line with the law, prevent fines)
    - It would enable them to see progress updates
    
    We should explore which of these expectations we can meet in the early delivery of app and which we cannot.

5. Users don’t always understand the difference between central and local government services due to its complexity, we should explore ways to manage the expectation that the app will enable local government services without making users learn about the difference.

6. Showing user profiles within the app created an expectation to be able to update them if information was out of date. We need to work with Digital Identity teams to explore how we can either manage that expectation or enable this within the app. 

7. Users found the concept of setting reminders valuable as this is currently managed in ad hoc ways so we could explore ways to enable this and deliver value for users.

8. Users expect the app to be relevant to them and their personal circumstances based on their experiences with other apps. This expectation aligns with the GOV.UK strategy so we could explore how we can enable this while we develop the infrastructure to support personalisation.

9. Within this sample, users with lower income and lower digital skills had experienced a stressful reality with lots of financial/health struggles. As a result, they might not care about the specifics of the app (e.g. app to web transition) as long as the app saves them time, helps them understand if they are entitled to support (e.g. benefits) and generally make their lives easier. We should be inclusive of these user groups and think of ways to improve their interactions with the government.
