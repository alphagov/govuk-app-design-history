## Research objectives

- Explore and understand peopleâ€™s behaviours and attitudes towards a gov.uk app
- Investigate the needs of people who interact with the government by using an app
- Inform next rounds of research
- Feed into the app proposition by identifying app concepts and opportunities

## What we did

- 1 Round of UR 
- 10 participants
- Concept testing: create an account and go through a DBS check
- Focus: subset of services, reuse of data 

## Key insights

Participants expect that a GOV.UK app would be able to keep them updated and alert them when they need to complete a task relevant to their life circumstances.

Participants expect to be able to complete a wide range of tasks within the GOV.UK app. This included things like renewing passports, tax and pension related tasks.

Participants expect to be able to sign in to the app and have their data stored so that they save time and see things relevant to them and their personal circumstances.

## What we showed users
